# Rock Paper Scissors CLI Game 🎮

A simple command-line version of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game built with **Node.js**.  
The user plays against the computer. The game uses random selection for the computer's move and compares it with the player's input.

- Randomly generates computer moves
- Compares moves and determines the winner
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Displays the result clearly in the console

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.

Clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
node Rock_Paper_Scissors.js rock

Replace `rock` with your move: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.

## ✅ Example Output

You win!
```
